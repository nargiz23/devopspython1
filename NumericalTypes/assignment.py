#we need to create program that will help us to calculate
#average exam score of a student
#we are given 3 var as exam1,exam2,exam3.
#calculate average score for a student
#70 40 97
#to solve question assign multiple var in signke line

exam1,exam2,exam3=70,40,97
average_score= (exam1 + exam2 + exam3 )/3

#problem

#nothin the output that indicates that
