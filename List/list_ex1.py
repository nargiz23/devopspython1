# Ask user 7 times to enter different integer numbers. 
# If user doesn't give you
# integer number ask again. Create a list using these 7 different numbers.
# Print second biggest number from the list. 

# How can I create a loop that repeats 7 times? 

#I can use range object -> range(7) -> 0,1,2,3,4,5,6 -> 
# it would give 7 numbers
# Therefore loop I use with range(7) would iterate 7 times.

# What am I expecting user to give me? 
# Only digits, and it should not start with 0.

# When what user gave us is not matching with
# what we are expecting. We should ask user
# again to enter a number.

# Second biggest number should be smaller than biggest number in list.
# To be able to find biggest number in a list max(list)
