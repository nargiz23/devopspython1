# Note: Functions that are associated with classes are called methods.

# We have to create a class to represent bank account. 
# functionalities for this account are:
#Initialize the bank account with an initial balance.
#Deposit a specified amount into the account.
# Withdraw a specified amount from the account, but do not allow overdrawing.
# Check the account balance.

# When we create a instance from Bank Account class, this action actually represents
# opening a new bank account. 
# IN the account we have functionalities,
# like, withdrawal, deposit, check balance
