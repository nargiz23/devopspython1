#While loop has similar working progress to  if statement with a
#little twist to it.
#The twist for a while is block of code in the while gets executed
#over and over again  until again boolexp for while becomes False.
#Therefore given condition for a while loop Should be
#Updated in the While LOOP Body.

#In its simples form,a while loop can be explaned as follows:
#check the condition
#if the condition is true ,execute the code inside the loop
#go back to step1.

#Lets print the numbers from 1 to 10

#what condition can i even provide for counting
#i would crete a int var
#i would increase this number throught out the loop body
#as condition i would check this var relation with number
#beacuse the question asks me to not over 10

count=1
while count <=10: 
    print(count) #1
    #i would increase the value of count
    count+=1
