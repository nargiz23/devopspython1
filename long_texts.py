#in python when we put texts in quotation marks
#we create string


#example:
#Hi,
#I hope ths email finds you well.I was wondering about our agreement.
print("""Hi,
    I hope ths email finds you well.
    I was wondering about our agreement.""")
#unlike when we have multyline string we have to define in 
#triple quotes(""" or ''')

print('''Display this line''')
